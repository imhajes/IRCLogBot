# IRC Logger Bot

This is a very simple bot which connects to a given IRC channel and creates markdown formatted logs.

I wrote this as a stopgap until Loki was set up on #knownchat, but figured it might be useful to others

## Usage

./bot -s server -p port -c channel -n nick -d logdirectory -a nickservpass
